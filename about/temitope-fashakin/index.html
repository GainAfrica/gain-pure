              Temitope Richard Fashakin is a social entrepreneur, educator and
              businessman. He is the founder of Giving Aid International Network
              (GAIN). This Nigerian-based organization, established in 2017, has
              earned a stirling reputation for assisting economic disempowered
              students get access to funding for quality education. The
              non-governmental organization has facilitated over five billion
              naira in scholarship funds and fellowship opportunities for a
              diverse spectrum of young people who would have been otherwise
              deprived of the transformative experience of world-class higher
              education.
              <br /><br />

              Temitope Fashakinâ€™s entrepreneurial spirit has also led him to set
              up a fashion-and-food services brand, Farii Ideas and Concept
              Services, and to nurture it into a top brand in Victoria Island,
              Lagos. In furtherance of his passion for social entrepreneurship,
              Temitope Fashakin established Quality, Price, Availability & Time
              (Qpat) Solutions, an outfit designed to provide cost-friendly
              educational services to schools and organizations. Qpat Solutions
              has made its services available to students from more than a
              hundred schools in Nigeria. The average SAT achievement score of
              Qpat beneficiaries ranks consistently above 1300 /1600.
              <br /><br />

              Temitope Fashakin is the founder of the education & literacy-based
              organizations bookspals.org and scholarsinresidence.org. He is
              also a donor to Ted.com, a global leader in the dissemination of
              innovative ideas. And he has been a member of the Stanford Social
              Innovation Review, the Yali Network and the United States
              Information Resource Center.
              <br /><br />

              Temitope Richard Fashakin studied Electrical and Electronics
              engineering at Obafemi Awolowo University after finishing his
              secondary school education at the Federal Government College,
              Okigwe, Imo State. His abiding passion for entrepreneurship and
              economic empowerment, which he began cultivating during his
              undergraduate studies, informed his founding of QPAT Solutions.
              The numerous students that have benefited from the organization's
              services, including 10 currently on full international
              scholarship, have received in excess of $5million in funding
              value.
              <br /><br />

              Temitope Fashakin believes in giving back to his community, and he
              has dedicated his life to doing such. That commitment was inspired
              by the legacy of his parents, especially his mother, whose
              devotion to putting disadvantaged families in her community on the
              path to economic independence by providing them with training and
              lift-off funds was exemplary. And Temitope Fashakin has passed the
              baton on to the next generation by supporting a kindred passion in
              his daughter. At the age 10, she co-founded Naijakids (www.9jakgb.
              Org). In under 4 years, Naijakids has distributed food, clothing,
              books, toys and computers worth over ten million naira to children
              in nine communities.
